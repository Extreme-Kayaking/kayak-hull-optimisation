# kayak-hull-optimisation
Efficiently optimising a kayak hull under constant fluid flows for a customisable compound metric assessing hydrodynamicity, stability, and buoyancy using Gaussian Processes. 

## Method
### Inputs
- Hull Parameter Constraints
- Fluid Flow Direction
- Fluid Flow Speed (by Galilean Relativity, this theoretically accounts also for the Kayak speed)
- Weight of the Kayaker

### Outputs
Assessing the quality of the hull by a compound metric taking into account:
#### Hydrodynamicity:
- Drag opposite the forward motion of the hull
#### Stability:
- Tipping Point
- Total Stability
- Diminishing Stability Point
- Initial Stability (Stiffness)
#### Buoyancy
- Reserve Buoyancy
